      <h1>Flagged IP Address</h1>
      <p>We hope this message finds you well.</p>

      <p>
        We're writing to inform you that our system has flagged an unusual
        activity associated with your account. Upon investigation, we have
        detected multiple unsuccessful login attempts from an IP address that
        appears to be unauthorized or suspicious.
      </p>

      <p>
        To ensure the security of your account, we have temporarily suspended
        access from the flagged IP address. If you recognize this activity as
        legitimate, please take the following actions:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Review the recent login attempts and verify if they were made by you
          or someone authorized to access your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the activity is legitimate, please reply to this email and provide
          additional details to assist us in verifying your identity.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, we strongly
          recommend changing your password immediately and enabling two-factor
          authentication for enhanced security.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        Please note that failure to respond to this email or confirm the
        legitimacy of the flagged activity may result in further security
        measures being taken, including permanent suspension of your account.
      </p>
